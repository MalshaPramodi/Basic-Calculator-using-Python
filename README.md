# Basic-Calculator-using-Python
Overview
This project is a simple, user-friendly calculator application built using Python's tkinter library. It provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations efficiently. The calculator supports both mouse clicks and keyboard inputs, making it easy to use.

Development Progress
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Implement basic arithmetic operations (Completed âœ…)
ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Add square and square root functions (Completed âœ…)
ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Improve GUI and keyboard shortcuts (Completed âœ…)
ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Package as an executable (.exe) (Completed âœ…)

## Tech Stack
Language: Python
GUI Framework: Tkinter
Testing & Debugging: Pythonâ€™s built-in testing tools

## Features
âœ… Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
âœ… Square Function: Calculate the square of a number
